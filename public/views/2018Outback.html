        The 2018 Subaru Outback features upgrades to its technology, comfort, and style — on top of Subaru Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive + 32 MPG**, a spacious and comfortable interior, and 8.7 inches of ground clearance. And it’s still the longest-lasting vehicle
        in its class.

          with a Lineartronic® CVT to deliver up to a fuel-efficient 32 MPG** highway. If even more capability is needed, a 256-hp 6-cylinder SUBARU BOXER® engine is also available.

          Longest-lasting Vehicle in Its Class

        <p>
          The Subaru Outback is the longest-lasting vehicle in its class[1], which should come as no surprise because 98% of Subaru vehicles sold in the last 10 years are still on the road today[2]. Just a couple of the reasons why the Outback retains its value
          better than any other vehicle in its class according to ALG[3].

          Conquer almost any terrain with 8.7 inches of ground clearance and standard X-MODE, which provides electronic optimization of the Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system for maximum traction on low-friction surfaces. X-MODE also incorporates Hill Descent Control
